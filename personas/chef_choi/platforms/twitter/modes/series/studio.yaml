# Image Critic Settings
critic:
  system_prompt: |
    Evaluate the images based on 'Realism' and 'Authenticity'.
    We are looking for a 'Candid Smartphone Snapshot' vibe, NOT a shiny commercial ad.
    The goal is to show the Chef's personal, unpretentious daily life.
  
  criteria: |
    1. Realism: Does it look like a real photo taken by a human? (Grain, slight blur, natural imperfections)
    2. Texture: Is the food texture appetizing but realistic? (Steam, crumbs, sauce gloss)
    3. Lighting: Is it natural? (Avoid generic studio lighting)
    4. Composition: Is it naturally imperfect? (Avoid perfect symmetry)
